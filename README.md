## **ToDo App: Version 2**

### **Technologies Used:**
HTML  
Javascript  
CSS

### **Libraries used:**
None

### **Purpose of the project:**
As with every version of this app I'll be expanding upon the functionality built in the last version. In this version I expanded upon the container system to include *Swimlanes* allowing users to create new lanes to shift ToDo's into, allowing for greater customisation.  

### **What this project does:**
The project has now moved to a state where you can add new Swimlanes and Todo cards and then rearrange the swimlanes and move the cards between them 

### **How to use the application:**
The last swimlane (The empty swimlane with a plus button) will allow you to generate new swimlanes. Clicking on the title of the swimlane will let you modify it. Once you've updated the title you can click anywhere else for it to update automatically in the database.
Each swimlane has a add button for creating new Todo cards. once a card has been created you can click on it to modify the text content. The cards can be dragged by clicking and holding then dragging to the swimlane you want it to exist in. 

### **What did I learn?**
This version of the project was a great chance for me to think about database relations and the best way to structure data in Google Firebase. Learning to use subcollections and then realising that they are not suited to what I was using them for.
